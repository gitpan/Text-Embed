Text-Embed version 0.02
=======================

Text-Embed is a simple module that solves a simple problem - keeping 
unwieldy chunks of text seperate from source code. 

If you need to keep large constant strings (or the likes) with your code, 
eg SQL/HTML/Source-Code Templates, then Text-Embed could be for you.

See the POD for the full abstract. 

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

On windows the above may not work. Text-Embed is a pure perl 
module, so you can simply copy Embed.pm to 

    C:\<YOUR_PERL_SITE_LIB>\Text\Embed.pm

Before you do, you may want to run:

    perl -Ilib t\Text-Embed.t

from the Text-Embed directory, to make sure all tests pass.
